The differnces between software engineering and traditional programming are as follows:
Software engineering focuses on creating intangible products like computer programs and applications while Traditional programming deals with tangible products e.g buildings, machines, hardwares and bridges.

Software engineering follows an iterative development process, where software is continuously refined and improved based on user feedback whikw Traditional programming follows a linear process where designs are finalized before constriction begins.

In Software engineering, process construction and development costs are low while in Traditional programming, process construction and development cost is high.

In software engineerring, maintenance and updates are necessary to keep software relevant, functional and secure while in Traditional programming, maintenance involves periodic inspections and repairs.
 
Software engineering relies on programming languages and software development tools while traditional programming uses specialized tools and equipment specific to their field, e.g heavy machinery for construction.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

Software Develpoment Life Cycle(SDLC) consists of various phases which are as follows:
PLANNING PHASE: This is the first phase of SDLC and It involves defining the project scope, goals, and objectives. The team identifies the requirements of the software, defines the project timeline, and creates a budget.

REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS PHASE:  In this phase, the team analyzes the requirements gathered during the planning phase. They identify the functional and non-functional requirements of the software, including the user interface, performance, and security requirements.

DESIGN PHASE:This phase involves creating a detailed design of the software. The team creates a detailed architecture, user interface, and data models. This phase is critical in ensuring that the software meets the requirements and is scalable and maintainable.

IMPLEMENTATION PHASE: The implementation phase involves writing the code for the software. The team develops the software using the design specifications created in the previous phase.

TESTING PHASE: The testing phase involves testing the software to ensure it meets the requirements and is free of defects. The team performs various types of testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.

DEPOLYMENT PHASE: The deployment phase involves deploying the software to the production environment. The team ensures that the software is installed and configured correctly, and that it is available for use by the end-users.

MAINTENANCE PHASE: The maintenance phase involves maintaining the software after it has been deployed. The team identifies and fixes defects, updates the software to ensure it remains compatible with changing technology, and makes improvements to the software to meet changing user requirements.


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Agile Model:
The Agile model is an iterative and incremental approach where the project is divided into smaller chunks, and each chunk is developed and tested incrementally.
The Agile model allows for flexibility and adaptability throughout the project lifecycle, with the ability to change direction or adjust scope as needed.
Agile Model emphasizes collaboration and communication among team members, customers, and stakeholders.
The Agile model focuses on continuous improvement, with regular retrospectives and feedback loops.

Waterfall Model:
The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach where eachphase is completed before moving on to the next one.
It is simple, easy to understand, and easy to manage
Thorough planning and execution: The project is planned in detail at the beginning, and each phase is executed in a predetermined order.
No iteration or feedback: Once a phase is completed, it cannot be changed or modified.
The Waterfall model is a highly structured approach with clear roles and responsibilities.


The Key differences between Agile and Waterfall models are as follows:

Agile is an iterative and flexible approach while Waterfall is a linear and structured approach.
Agile planning is continuous and adaptive while Waterfall model  requires thorough planning upfront.
Agile encourages continuous feedback and iteration while Waterfall does not allow for feedback or iteration.
Agile emphasizes collaboration and self-organizing teams while Waterfall has clear roles and responsibilities.
Agile allows changes and adjustments throughout the project lifecycle while Waterfall is less flexible.

The Waterfall model is more preferred for projects with a clear and well-defined scope, where the requirements are well-understood, and the outcome is predictable or unlikely to change.
The Agile model is better suited for projects with uncertain or changing requirements, where the outcome is not well-defined, or where the project scope needs to be adjusted during development

Requirements Engineering: 
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements to ensure that software meets the needs and expectations of stakeholders. It involves activities such as elicitation, analysis, specification, and verification to guarantee that the software is developed correctly and meets the requirements of its users.

Requirement engineering process involves several stages which includes:

FEASIBILITY STUDY: Evaluating the viability of the proposed system.
Problem structuring: Identifying and structuring the problem to be solved.
REQUIREMENTS ELICITATION: It involves gathering information about the needs and expectations of stakeholders.
REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS: Understanding, recording, and managing the demands of stakeholders.
REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION: Developing a clear and concise description of the requirements.
REQUIREMENT VERIFICATION: Ensuring that the software meets the specified requirements.

Importance of Requirements Engineering:

Requirements engineering provides a framework for project development, ensuring that the software is developed correctly and meets the needs of its users.

It helps to identify and manage the expectations of stakeholders, ensuring that the software meets their needs and expectations.

Proper requirements engineering reduces errors and improves project clarity, ensuring that the software is developed correctly and meets the needs of its users.

Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity in software design refers to the practice of breaking down a complex software system into smaller, independent modules or components that can be developed, tested, and maintained separately. These modules are designed to be relatively independent of each other, allowing for easier maintenance, testing, and reusability of code.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Software testing consist of four levels, each with a specific purpose and scope. These levels are:

Unit Testing: This is the first level of software testing, where individual units or components of the software are tested in isolation. This level of testing is performed by developers to ensure that each unit or component is functioning as expected. Unit testing checks if software components are fulfilling their functionalities or not.

Integration testing is the second level of software testing, where multiple units or components are combined and tested as a group to ensure that they work together seamlessly. This level of testing checks the data flow from one module to other modules. Integration testing is performed by testers to ensure that the integrated system is ready for system testing.

System Testing: This is the third level of software testing, where the entire system is tested to ensure that it meets both functional and non-functional requirements. This level of testing evaluates the systemâ€™s performance, security, and usability. System testing is performed by testers to ensure that the system is ready for acceptance testing.

Acceptance testing: This is the final level of software testing, where the system is tested to ensure that it meets the end-user requirements and is ready for deployment. This level of testing is performed by the client or end-user to ensure that the system meets their specifications or contract requirements.

Software testing is crucial in software development lifecycle because it ensures quality and reliability of software products.

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. They track changes made to files, allowing developers to recall specific versions later if needed. This enables teams to collaborate, work on parallel projects, and maintain a record of changes made to the codebase.

Importance of Version Control System

With version control systems, developers can maintain a consistent codebase. Every change made to the code is stored in the system, ensuring that the entire team is working on the same version. This eliminates the hassle of dealing with multiple copies and allows for efficient collaboration.

It significantly simplifies collaboration among developers. Multiple team members can work on the same project simultaneously, and any modifications are automatically synced with the central repository. This facilitates seamless teamwork and minimizes conflicts that arise from working on shared codebases.

Error Recovery: It provides a safety net for developers by offering the ability to revert to previous versions of the code. If a mistake is made or a bug is introduced, developers can easily roll back to a known working state. This saves valuable time and ensures that the project remains on track.

Version control systems maintain a detailed history of changes made to the codebase. Each commit is documented, including the author, timestamp, and a description of the modifications.

Examples of popular version control systems and their features.
